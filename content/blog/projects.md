## University Projects

#### Computergraphics (4th semester)

In computergraphics i created a simple `QT Application` in `cpp`. I used `OpenGL` to learn about the different concepts of computer graphics and combined them with a simple `gimbal animation`. See [here](https://github.com/MordragT/Computergrafik) for the github page.

#### Compiler Construction (5th semester)

I created a compiler for a very simple java like language named `minijava fun proc`. I compiled the language into `JVM bytecode`, which can easily be run by ureself. [Here](https://github.com/MordragT/Compilerbau) is the repository with more information.

#### Databases and Webtechnologies 1 (3rd semester)

I created a website for ordering food in the canteen. I used `Laravel` and therefor `PHP` aswell. And of course `HTML` and `CSS`, but for the styling i used often [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) too. See the [repository](https://github.com/MordragT/DBWT) for more information.

#### Databases and Webtechnologies 2 (4th semester)

This was the follow up course to `DBWT 1`. I learned more about `Laravel` and used `javascript` aswell as `vue` for the frontend. The goal wasnt necessary to create one big website, but the tasks were more spread than in the first course. Nevertheless [here](https://github.com/MordragT/DBWT2) is the link to the repository.

#### Managy - Softwareengineering (3rd semester)

This project was used to learn more about working in a team and developing software for a customer. In my team we developed an android app to manage the everyday life of an student writing a thesis. [Link](https://github.com/MordragT/managy) to the repository, with more presentations.

## Other Projects

Here are other projects i did in my freetime.

---

#### Zen Loader

This library is capable of loading different file formats of the [Zengin](https://www.moddb.com/engines/zengin) game engine used in the [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)) games. There exists a similar [library](https://github.com/ataulien/ZenLib) implemented in `cpp`, which is very helpful and serves as a reference for this [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) [library](https://github.com/MordragT/zen-loader).

---

#### Injex

This library provides an api to inject into and/or alter the memory of other processes. [Here](https://github.com/MordragT/injex) is the repository.

#### Secret Santa

I created this for christmas day in 2020 to draft the tickets for secret santa online. [Repository](https://github.com/MordragT/secret-santa)...
